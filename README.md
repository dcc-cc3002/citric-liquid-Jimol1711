## Tarea 2 - Juan Ignacio Molina: Specifications

In the following paragraphs, the implemented functionalities of the main structure of the game are specified. It's updated from the 
previous assignment.

The project is divided on three packages, Panels, Units and Norma, and the Units package has another package WildUnits on it. The Panels 
package contains the constructors for the Panel objects, which are the components of a board on a game. The Units package contains the 
constructors for the Units, which are the Entities that interact in said board. They can be either playable (Therefore dependant of users 
decisions) or non-playable, which would correspond to those on the WildUnits package, which contains a trait for said Units as well as it's
concrete classes. The Norma package contains the constructor for the Norma, which is an object that determines what player wins a 
particular instance of a game.

All the different Panels extend from the abstract Class "AbstractPanel" which itself extends from the "Panel" trait. The Panel trait 
defines attributes that are shared amongst any Panel entity (characters, panels next to it, etc.) plus methods that are shared as well.

The Units package contains the Units trait, which defines attributes and methods that are shared amongst any Unit entity (Hit Points, 
Attack, etc). Those shared attributes and methods are implemented on an abstract class "AbstractUnit". Since not all Units are playable, 
the Units trait has to be divided in another two classes. The first one is the PlayerCharacter class. This class implements any attribute 
or method that is specific to a PlayerCharacter. The PlayerCharacter is used as a type in some cases, since players can vary a lot and are 
unique to each user. The second class is the "Wild Unit" inside the WildUnits package. The trait "WildUnit" is created so that it can be 
used as a type. Wild Units are non-playable entities that can fight the player. They have set attributes, and have a particular behaviour 
different to playable entities. They are also divided in three different types, Chicken, RoboBall and Seagull, each of them with their own 
set attributes.

The Class PlayerCharacter and Panel didn't receive major changes on their documentation. All the other classes do have the proper
documentation.
